🎓 **Educational Journey:** I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Florida. Just like a superhero fine-tuning his powers, I'm honing my coding skills to save the digital world, one bug at a time!

🌐 **Tech Wizardry:** My tech expertise spans from crafting elegant code to deploying robust solutions. I bring clarity and simplicity to complex systems—because even in the tech world, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication!

🔧 **Professional Experience:**
I've been actively involved in a variety of roles that showcase my versatility across the tech spectrum. As a **Software Developer** at Hexagon Pvt Ltd, I enhanced 3D modeling software and contributed to the cloud migration of applications, utilizing C#, .NET, and Node.js. During my **Internship** at Divideite, I developed the front-end of an educational platform using React.js and implemented REST APIs using Node.js and MongoDB. My role as a **Graduate Student Research Assistant** at the University of Florida involved upgrading an EJS legacy website to a React interface, conducting data analysis with Python, and integrating full stack development with machine learning for innovative solutions in housing research.

🤖 **Machine Learning Mastery:**
Diving deep into the world of data, I have led several projects that use machine learning to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. My work includes analyzing the Florida housing market to discover trends in affordability and utilizing advanced data visualization techniques to present complex information clearly and effectively.

### 🌍 Open Source Contributions
I have actively contributed to the open source community, enhancing tools that many developers rely on. My contributions include work on projects like Pandas and Taipy, where I've added features and improved functionality, spreading a bit of my own code magic into these essential tools.
