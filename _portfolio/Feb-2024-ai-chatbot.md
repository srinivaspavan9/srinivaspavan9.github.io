This project involves the creation of an advanced AI chatbot designed to assist users in optimizing their resumes and providing career guidance. The chatbot utilizes the LLMA-2 LLM model and TensorRT LLM engine in Python, optimized for enhanced performance using NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM.

Key Features:
- **LLM Integration**: The chatbot integrates cutting-edge language model technologies including LLMA-2 and TensorRT to provide precise and contextually aware responses.
- **User Interface**: A ChatGPT-like web interface built using ReactJS allows for interactive engagement, capturing user feedback to continuously improve the system's responses and functionalities.
- **Tech Stack**: Utilizes a combination of Langchain, Pinecone, and Streamlit for backend operations, ensuring robust data handling and response generation capabilities.

The aim of this project is not only to assist individuals in enhancing their professional presentations through their resumes but also to provide actionable career advice through an accessible and interactive digital platform.
